# VehicleDetails
Web API with CRUD operations on Vehicle Entity.
I have implemented the mentioned (GET,POST,PUT,DELETE) HTTP Routes for the application.
I have also enabled CORS (Cross Origin Resource Sharing) on this application
In my solution I have used SQL Server Express as my database to store the vehicle information. I have used Ado .net to communicate with the database server.
I have used .net framework version 4.6.1
I have used VisualStudio Community Edition 2017 as an IDE for my solution. 
I have included the compressed version of my solution and a sql file which contains the database creation statements.
